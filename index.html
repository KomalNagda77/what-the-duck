            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>For years, humans have underestimated ducks. "Oh, look at them, waddling around, minding their own business," they said.</p>
            <p><strong>Fools.</strong></p>
            <p>Beneath those innocent beady eyes and flappy feet lies a <strong>highly sophisticated secret society</strong>—<em>The Webbed Order</em>. Their leader, the infamous <strong>Duke Quackington III</strong>, has had enough of our <em>bread-based bribery</em> and <em>casual pond invasions</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>They are fighting back.</strong></p>
            <p>Strange things are happening:
                <ul>
                    <li>People are waking up to find their shoes filled with pond water.</li>
                    <li>Mysterious "quack" sounds are being heard through radio frequencies at odd hours.</li>
                    <li>GPS devices are mysteriously rerouting humans straight into duck-infested lakes.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The media refuses to report on it. The government is silent.</p>
            <p>But you? <strong>You know something’s up.</strong></p>
            <p>There is only one clue—the first breadcrumb in a long trail of secrets. A rogue duck, who defected from the Order, has left it behind. But be careful—<strong>the ducks don’t like snitches.</strong></p>
